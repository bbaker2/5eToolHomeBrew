    "This wand has 3 charges. When casting a spell that is from the school of {@i illusion}, you may spend charges to reduce the spell slot cost of the spell to a minimum of level 1. You must know the spell and you must have the spell prepared.",
    "{@i Example:} You are a level 5 Wizard. You have prepared {@spell Major Image|phb} but you have already used your two level 3 spell slots. You may spend two charges to reduce the spell cost of {@spell Major Image|phb} to level 1 (But the spell is still cast at level 3)"
